Here you find some examples and tutorials for the R package RepeatABEL.
Examples showing how to use the package functionality are shown in the PDF RepeatABEL_Tutorial.pdf. The engine inside RepeatABEL doing most of the work is the hglm package available on CRAN. If you want to find out more about the hglm package see the documentation on CRAN and the GitHub repository https://github.com/larsronn/HGLM-resources .

In this repository, you also find two additional functions not included in the RepeatABEL package on CRAN yet. The code in Heritability_DeltaMethod_v2.R computes the heritability and its standard error using the delta method given data analyzed in the RepeatABEK package. There is an example included in the file. The second function, rGLSinteraction, is found in the file rGLSinteraction.R, where you can fit a GWAS based on a model including GxE. Example code is found in the file rGLSinteraction_ExampleCode.R.
